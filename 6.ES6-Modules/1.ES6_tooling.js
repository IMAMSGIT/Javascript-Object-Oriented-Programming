// important for onlty borwser application
// Modern JS needs two kinds of tools
// 1-Transpiler, 2-Bundler
// 1-Transpiler means Translator+compiler
// It's a tool we give it to our modern JS
// and it converts to our JS code that all browser understand
// 2-Bundler - is responsible for combining
// all our JS files into one JS file
// which we call Bundle ex. WEBPACK
