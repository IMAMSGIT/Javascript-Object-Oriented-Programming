// inheritance is not the only way to code reuse
// other thing called composition can be used
// Example
// Animal(eat()) - Mammal(walk()),Fish(swim())- Person,Dog,Goldfish
// we created so many hierarchies, should be avoided because they are very fragile
// Don't go more than one level
// Favor composition over Inheritance
// We can use Mixin ti achieve Composition
